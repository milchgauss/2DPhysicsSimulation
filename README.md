# 2DPhysicsSimulation
A series of simulations I created with the 3-D physics engine (Matter.js) with Javascript. 
The first two simulations were made possible by Coding Train on YT! Once I became more familiar with the Matter.js library, I created the third simulation.
I created 3 dynamic bodies (2 dynamic rectangular bodies and 1 dynamic circular body), a static circular body, and two chains. I accessed the Body[] array of the
chain and changed the last element of the array to "static" to create a "bridge-like" object.
